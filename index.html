     <h1><em>About Me</em></h1>
      <p>My tale began on October 29<sup>th</sup>, 1995, in St John's, Newfoundland. My parents, a pharmaceutical representative and an English teacher, were Newfoundland natives themselves. We did not stay in St.John's long, and I spent my childhood bouncing between Ottawa and Montreal. Upon completion of high school, I attended St Mary's University for 2 years, studying Criminology, before dropping out in 2015.</p>
      <p>I found myself in Halifax with little money and few prospects, so I opted to join the Canadian Armed Forces. I spent 3 years as a member of the Surveillance and Target Acquisition Battery, 1<sup>st</sup> Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, completing my contract and returning home to Ottawa. I worked a number of jobs in a number of fields, from landscaping to interior design, before choosing to start my own business in the field of videography.</p>
